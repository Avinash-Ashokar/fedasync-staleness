# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical development files, test scripts, intermediate results, and files from the project's evolution.

## Contents

### Historical Scripts
- `solution.py`: Early TrustWeight implementation (later standardized)
- `damn.py`: FedBuff notebook converted to script (reference implementation)
- `final.py`: Intermediate development script

### Test Scripts
- `test_*.py`: Various test scripts for TrustWeight and other methods
- `run_*.py`: Experiment runner scripts
- `quick_test*.py`: Quick test scripts
- `show_*.py`: Configuration display scripts

### Intermediate Results
- `*.json`: Analysis result files (branch comparisons, experiment summaries)
- `*.csv`: Intermediate experiment result files
- `experiment_summary*.txt`: Text summaries of experiments
- `EXPERIMENT_RESULTS_TABLE*.md`: Experiment result tables

## Purpose

This archive preserves:
- Development history and evolution
- Test scripts used during development
- Intermediate analysis results
- Reference implementations

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference. For current implementations, see:
- `FedAsync/`, `FedBuff/`, `TrustWeight/` for core implementations
- `experiments/notebooks/` for current notebooks
- `logs/` for current experiment results
